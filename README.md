# First the dataset has been cleaned up. 6 missing values have been founds and the rows have been remove out from the database.
# Using correlation to find the relationship between all the variable and the target variables. The varaible that has the lowest relationship will be excluded. 9 significants features have been picked.
# The whole dataset has been slpit into train and test set. 
# Different classificaiton models has been generate on the training set and perform prediction on test set features. Actual and predicted value is compared to test the accuracy.
# 4 classificaiton model algorithm has been generated which are Logistic regression, Knn, Naive Bayes and Decision tree.
# Accuracy for Logistic Regression = 0.84
# Accuracy for Knn = 0.826
# Accuracy for Decision Tree = 0.76
# Accuracy for Naive Bayes = 0.853
